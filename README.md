# Big Map Navigation
## Introduction
This Project is about testing a game mechanic in python : the camera centered in the player in upper view, and the playr can move on a big map, but the camera will stay centered

I begin this project in tkinter (for tsting), and then I ll update this to pygame

## Final Objective
At the end, I want to build a playable maze game including different floors of different levels, dynamic lighting, shadow rendering, AI with pathfinding
